# Anypoint Platform Patterns

This is a nascent collection of patterns for using Anypoint Platform, a commercial offering by MuleSoft (a Salesforce company).

The Anypoint Platform is a set of products and features for developing and operating various types of cloud-native software components and services, including integration applications and HTTP APIs.
When we say "using" the Anypoint Platform we therefore mean using it to architect, design, implement, and operate these software components and services.

As this collection of patterns grows, it will form a coherent and complete pattern language for the Anypoint Platform. At least that's the vision.
